<div class="game-how-to-text">
<p>First we take your age, which is <%= age %>, and we multiply it by a random number. This is the "game number". Then we take your age again, and based on your age, we multiply it by three random numbers to get three "cat numbers". When you push on the cat number button it adds that amount to the "player number". Your goal, <%= name %>, is to get the player number to exactly match the game number without going over.</p>
<p>If you get the game number exactly you win. Otherwise, you lose. If you win three times the score goes up one point, and if you lose three times, the score goes down one point.</p>
