# Take catFancier app and Achieve CRUD, Part I

## Copy Repo

* Go to gitHub and setup a new repository. Copy the https address.
* Open up the repo on your desktop that you would like to clone, with VSC. In the terminal type in git push --mirror and the https you copied to the new repo on gitHub. Go to gitHub, refresh and make sure the repo is there.
* With the http still on the clipboard, open up gitBash or the command line and type in git clone and the https address of the new repository (The address should still be on your clipboard).
* IMPORTANT Do not make a new folder on your computer, let git do it for you!
* In file manager, go to the root directory, something like Local Disc C:/users/your-user-name. The cloned repository should be in the your-user-name folder. Cut and paste to desktop.
* Open up the newly created repo on your desktop with VSC. Open the terminal and type npm i. The dependencies should be downloaded and the node_modules appear.
* Copy and paste the .env file from the old repo into the new repo.
* The new repo (on the desktop) should be good to change, copy, add and push to gitHub.

## Change views

### views/layouts

* In other-page.ejs change the text to: "Hello <%= name %>, which of these is your favorite cat picture?"
* Still in other-page.ejs add two more cat gifs. Above the three gifs add the text: "Please Click on Your Favorite". Leave the 'data-age' so that value is still passed to javascript.
* In order to pass the img src in the req.body make a form with a hidden input for each cat gif and wrap the image in a button.
* In the hidden input the name="src" and the value will be the img src. The form action is '/third-page' and the method is POST.
* Make any adjustments in css/html so that the cat gifs presentable as a comparable/clickable group.
* other-page.ejs should now look something like this:

````
<div class="cat-container">
<h1 id="catTitle" data-name="<%= name %>">Hello, <%= name %>, which is your favorite cat picture?</h1>
<h2 id="catAge" data-age="<%= age %>">Please click on your favorite!</h2>
<div class="cat-image-div">
<form action="/third-page/<%= id %>" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="src" value="assets/images/disgusting.gif" />
<button type="submit"><img src="assets/images/disgusting.gif" /></button>
</form>
<form action="/third-page/<%= id %>" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="src" value="/images/justGross.gif" />
<button type="submit"><img src="assets/images/justGross.gif" /></button>
</form>
<form action="/third-page/<%= id %>" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="src" value="assets/images/justaintright.gif" />
<button type="submit"><img src="assets/images/justaintright.gif" /></button>
</form>
</div>
</div>

````

### routes/index.js

* Change the router.get '/third-page' to router.post'/third-page'

### views/layouts

* other-page.ejs is getting too long. Make the form into a partial.
* In views make a new folder called "partials" and in partials make a file called "cat-img-form.ejs".
* Cut and paste the entire cat-image-div into "cat-img-form.ejs".
* Include "cat-img-form.ejs" into other-page.ejs:

````

//other-page.ejs
<div class="cat-container">
<h1 id="catTitle" data-name="<%= name %>">Hello, <%= name %>, which is your favorite cat picture?</h1>
<h2 id="catAge" data-age="<%= age %>">Please click on your favorite!</h2>
<%- include('../partials/cat-img-form.ejs') %>
</div>

//cat-img-form.ejs
<div class="cat-image-div">
<form action="/third-page/<%= id %>" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="src" value="/assets/images/disgusting.gif"/>
<button type="submit"><img src="assets/images/disgusting.gif" /></button>
</form>
<form action="/third-page/<%= id %>" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="src" value="/assets/images/justGross.gif"/>
<button type="submit"><img src="assets/images/justGross.gif" /></button>
</form>
<form action="/third-page/<%= id %>" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="src" value="/assets/images/justaintright.gif"/>
<button type="submit"><img src="assets/images/justaintright.gif" /></button>
</form>
</div>


````

* Currently '/third-page/:id' just returns json with the user information. Let's update catFancier with a favorite cat gif, after pushing to gitHub.

## Expand the model

### model/catFancier.js

* add a field, favoriteCatImg, that is a string, not required.
* catFancier should look like this:

````
const mongoose = require('mongoose');


const CatFancierSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true
    },
    age: {
        type: Number,
        required: true,
        trim: true
    },
    favoriteCatImg: {
        type: String,
        trim: true
    }
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('CatFancier', CatFancierSchema);

````

* Check to make sure is working and push to gitHub

## Update the Database

### routes/index.js

* In router.post '/third-page/:id' let src = req.body.src and id = req.params.id .
* findByIdAndUpdate()
	1. First parameter _id : id  --first parameter is always id;
	2. Second parameter { $set{ modelKeyToUpdate: value} } --that which needs to be updated;
	3. Third parameter { new : true } --boolean value, return the updated document;
	4. Fourth parameter (err, data) => {} --callback, check for errors and do something with the data.
* After updating the database, in the callback, find the document that was just updated and return the data.
* The router.post 'third/page/:id' should look like this:

````
router.post('/third-page/:id', (req, res) => {
    let src = req.body.src;
    let id = req.params.id;
    CatFancier.findByIdAndUpdate({ _id : id}, { $set: { favoriteCatImg : src } }, { new: true }, (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
        } else {
            let id = data.id;
            CatFancier.findById({ _id : id }, (err, data) => {
                if (err){
                    console.log(err);
                }else{
                    let name = data.name;
                    let age = data.age;
                    let fci = data.favoriteCatImg;
                    let id = data._id;
                    res.json({ name, age, fci, id });
                }
            });
        }
    });
    
});

````

* Check to see that everything is working and push to gitHub.

## Render changes 

### layouts/views

* In layouts make a view that renders the catFancier's information, name, age and favorite cat image. Beside each field give the catFancier the option to delete his or profile and return to the initial view. (We will not realize any of these changes until part two).
* Call the view "third-page.ejs", have it say, "<%= name %>, here is the information I have about you, is this correct?" followed by the information.
* To get the image let the src="<%= fci %>
* Beside each field have a button that says: "edit" or "change". The button should point to '/update/<name-of-field>/<%= id %>'.
* Have a button to click if everything is good, and the catFancier wants to proceed.
* Finally have a button that gives the catFancier the option to delete the profile.
* Instead of returning json at the end of router.post 'third-page/:id', render third-page.ejs, passing in all of the values.
* Check to make sure that everything renders (it won't or shouldn't work yet) and push to gitHub.
* third-page.ejs should look similar to this:

````
h1>Hey, <%= name %>, here is the information we have on you. Let me know if this is correct!</h1>

<div>
<p>Your name is <%= name %>.</p> <button type='button' onClick="window.location.href='/update/name/<%= id %>'">edit</button>
</div>
<div>
<p>You are <%= age %> years old.</p> <button type='button' onClick="window.location.href='/update/age/<%= id %>'">edit</button>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your favorite cat pic is</p> 
<img src="<%= fci %>"/> <button type='button' onClick="window.location.href='/update/fci/<%= id %>'">edit</button>
</div>
<div>
<button type="button"  value="<%= id %>" onClick="window.location.href= '/restOfSite'">Yes, that's me!</button>
</div>
<div>
<button type="button" onClick="window.location.href= '/delete/<%= id %>'">That's weird, please delete my profile</button>
</div>
